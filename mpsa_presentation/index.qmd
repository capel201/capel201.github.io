## Why is it important? {.smaller}

<br>

### The Post-Roe Landscape
- Overturning of Roe v. Wade (2022) as pivotal moment
- Paradox: Stable public opinion vs heightened political salience

### Theoretical Puzzle {.smaller}
- Persistent stability in abortion attitudes vs:
  - Shifting norms on other social issues (same-sex marriage, cannabis)
  - Growing affective polarization
  - Emergence of lifestyle politics

---

## Literature Review {.smaller}
### Traditional Determinants
1. **Religious Factors**  
   - Affiliation vs. religiosity  
   - Denominational differences (Catholic/Protestant vs Jewish/mainline)  

2. **Socioeconomic Variables**  
   - Education gradient paradox  
   - Mediated gender/ethnicity effects  

3. **Political Alignment**  
   - Partisan sorting since 1980s  
   - Bidirectional relationship with ideology  

---

## New Frontier: Lifestyle Politics {.smaller}
- Cultural polarization manifest in consumption patterns  
- "Prius vs Pickup Truck" political identities  
- Theoretical framework: Lifestyle as social identifier  

---

## Methodology {.smaller}
### Data Collection
- **Datagotchi** gamified survey (n=18,879)  
- Focus on abortion question respondents (n=2,012)  

### Analytical Approach
1. Correlation test of 30 variables  
2. Multivariate regression analysis  
3. Interaction testing (377 combinations)  

---

## Key Findings {.smaller}
### Correlation associations
- Strongest predictors:  
  - Partisan ID (Dem: +0.35, Rep: -0.40)  
  - Religiosity (-0.30)  
  - Lifestyle markers (Urban/Prius +0.22 vs Rural/Pickup -0.22)  

*Visual: Correlation heatmap (Figure 1)*

---

## Regression Analysis {.smaller}
- Socioeconomic factors dominate main effects:  
  - Strong Republican ID: -0.365***  
  - Muslim affiliation: -0.366***  
  - Jewish affiliation: +0.163*  

- Lifestyle variables gain significance through interactions  

*Visual: Regression coefficients plot (Figure 2)*

---

## Interaction Effects {.smaller}
### Amplification Patterns
1. **Republican Identity**  
   - Strengthened by: Hunting (+0.559**), Gun ownership (+0.328***)  
   - Weakened by: Craft beer consumption (-0.227***)  

2. **Ethnicity Modifiers**  
   - Native American: Walking (-0.404***) vs SUV (+0.402*)  
   - White: Motorcycles (+0.383**) vs Fishing (-0.117*)

## Theoretical Implications {.smaller}
- Lifestyle choices as polarization amplifiers  
- Cultural "package deals" in political identity  

---

## Discussion {.smaller}
### Contributions
1. Maps new lifestyle dimension of abortion politics  
2. Reveals interaction effects > individual predictors  
3. Demonstrates cultural embedding of policy attitudes  

### Limitations
- Non-causal correlational design  
- Binary abortion measure  
- Sample size constraints  

---

## Conclusion {.smaller}
### Key Takeaways
- Traditional factors remain necessary but insufficient  
- Lifestyle markers act as polarization multipliers  
- Abortion attitudes reflect broader cultural cleavages
